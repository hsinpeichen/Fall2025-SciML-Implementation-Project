# Fall2025-SciML-Implementation-Project
Implementation Project of SciML course (Fall 2025) at UT Austin.

This repository contains the source code for an implementation project from the Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) course at The University of Texas at Austin (Instructor: Professor Krishna Kumar). The neural network code is open to the public to benefit the broader AI and astrophysics research communities. The network architecture follows Behrens et al. (2024), while the provided training dataset is based on UCLCHEM chemical models from my work (in prep.) and the STARFORGE simulations from Fitz Axen et al. (2024).
